While Gear Development Company is one of many contributors to the Gear Protocol, the **Gear Foundation** is an independent nonprofit foundation intended to support the development and usage of a Gear Network. 

The Gear Foundation's mission is to lower the barrier to entry for blockchain development, to introduce an entirely new pool of talented developers to the Web3 and blockchain industry, onboarding them to the innovative and interoperable Substrate ecosystem. This will spur adoption and usage of blockchain technology, unleashing the potential of the next evolution of the internet - Web3.

**Gear Foundation** wants to support developers and applications that will add utility to the Gear ecosystem. Projects have the ability to participate in the Gear ecosystem by joining the Grants Program. It provides support and expertise that will maximize the project's usage and development. Projects joined the program may receive access to resourcing, developer tools, end-to-end support and a network of developers and connections throughout the industry.

Another initiative set up by **Gear Foundation** is the Gear Ambassador program. It is intended to provide a platform for members of the Gear community to organize, participate in, and create awareness about the Gear ecosystem. The main goal of the ambassador program is to educate the Gear community and others about developments in Web3 technology and Gear Network. This includes producing original educational and informational content like videos and articles, organizing and hosting online and in-person development workshops and hackathons, contributing to technical documentation, translating existing educational material, and engaging with community platforms by sharing knowledge about Gear and answering questions on Discord or partaking in conversations on platforms like Telegram.

Moreover, the **Gear Foundation** collaborates with, and supports, existing projects that are written on different frameworks and running on other networks to deploy their applications on a Gear Network. Gearâ€™s simple and understandable framework is capable of enabling effortless re-implementation of existing smart contracts from other networks. This, in turn, has the potential to enhance cross-chain interoperability and expand the utilization of these applications.
