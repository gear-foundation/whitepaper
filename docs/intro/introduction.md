Gear Protocol is an advanced Substrate-based Wasm programming platform. It was designed to enable developers to build and operate custom-logic decentralized applications (dApps) efficiently. The versatility of Gear Protocol makes it an ideal solution for a range of scenarios:

- Gear empowers developers to execute custom logic programs and create dApps on a decentralized Gear-powered network (such as the [Vara Network](https://vara.network/)) at speeds comparable to native execution. This allows developers to deploy practically any codebase to the network and have their users interact with it seamlessly.
- A [Gear node](/docs/components/node.md) can be used as a standalone instance running microservices, middleware, open APIs, and more, offering enhanced flexibility and autonomy.
- Gear offers compatibility with Substrate-supported blockchains on platforms, further expanding its functional reach and versatility.
- Networks deployed using Gear Protocol can provide functionality typically only available to centralized Web2 environments, like parallel processing, autonomous execution, gasless transactions and more. This enables developers to create a wider range of dApps and services with richer feature sets.

Substrate-based chains, like those deployed using Gear Protocol, bring significant enhancements to the blockchain landscape, such as employing energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms, and facilitating community-based authority. Furthermore, these chains make use of fast and cost-effective program and smart contract engines powered by the Wasm Virtual Machine. This virtual machine is capable of supporting any general-purpose programming language that can be compiled into Wasm, providing a welcoming and universal runtime for developers.
