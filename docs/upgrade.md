As any software system, blockchains tend to update with security patches or other changes in the code. First blockchains had to create a fork in order to update. Each fork causes lack of stability as well as price volatility. It is difficult to coordinate updates that should be agreed by the whole community in the decentralized system.

Since **Gear** is based on the Substrate blockchain development framework, it supports forkless runtime upgrades. Substrate makes it possible to deploy enhanced runtime capabilities (including breaking changes) without a hard fork. Because the definition of the runtime is itself an element in a Substrate chain's state, network participants may update this value by way of an extrinsic.
