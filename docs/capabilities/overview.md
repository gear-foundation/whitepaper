**Gear** enables individuals to create and execute custom-logic programs in a decentralized manner and more. 

Gear can be considered as a go-to solution for the following cases:
- Provide a technological foundation for constructing highly scalable and rapid decentralized Layer-1 networks (such as the [Vara Network](https://vara.network/)).
- Run arbitrary business logic dApps on Gear-powered networks at near-native speeds. Upload programs to the network and interact with them.
- Reduce the computational burden on blockchains by offloading highly intensive calculations using Gear node with WAVM, and then prove the correctness of these calculations on any blockchain.
- Use a Gear node as a standalone instance running microservices, middleware, open API and more.
- Establish cross-chain communications between other Substrate-supported blockchains.
