The key to the success and broad adoption of Gear technology lies in its ease of use and fast onboarding process, especially for program developers.

To facilitate this, a comprehensive knowledge hub, the **[Gear Wiki](https://wiki.gear-tech.io/)**, is available. This resource includes detailed information about Gear's components, Rust libraries, how to build, run, and interact with the Node, and how to write and test programs.

The Wiki also offers multiple **[examples](https://wiki.gear-tech.io/docs/examples/prerequisites)** of programs and smart contracts for popular use cases such as token standards (fungible, non-fungible and more), games, DeFi, infrastructure, auctions, supply chain, ZK, DAO and more. Some smart contract examples are accompanied with the user interface implementation that demonstrates integration capabilities between the frontend/backend and smart contracts on a Gear Network.

Alongside the Wiki is **[Gear IDEA](https://idea.gear-tech.io/)**, a tool that provides developers with an easy and efficient way to deploy programs to Gear networks and interact with them directly in their browser. It's designed to make it easier for developers to get familiar with the Gear Protocol, manage accounts and balances, observe transaction events, and more.
