Gear opens doors for traditional and Web2 businesses, ensuring their transition into more transparent, reliable, and sustainable services using decentralized Web3 technology under the hood.

Many Web2 services operate on a subscription basis, with a critical feature being automatic subscription renewal. Upon expiration, money is automatically debited from the wallet, renewing the subscription without user intervention. Gear facilitates easy self-invocation of programs without introducing centralized components through a few functions in the code. A program can dispatch a delayed message to itself across a defined number of blocks, contingent upon sufficient reserved gas to place the message in the Waitlist.

Decentralized Internet (DNS) can demonstrate an on-chain server-less approach to web sites and web applications hosting. Unlike server-based DNS built on centralized components and services, decentralized solutions running on the blockchain are characterized by boosted data security, enhanced data reconciliation, minimized system weak points, optimized resource allocation, and demonstrated great fault tolerance. It brings all the benefits of decentralization such as censorship resistance, security resilience, high transparency.

Supply chain management traditionally suffered due to inefficient systems where documents would pass through multiple parties, increasing the risk of fraud and loss of data. However, smart contracts can nullify such risk by automating most supply chain processes. They reduce complexity by processing transactions automatically and verifiably in real-time, which improves efficiency and allows supply chains to become more agile. And they also provide a traceable history of transactions, which improves transparency and strengthens trust between all parties involved in a supply chain.

Zero-knowledge cryptography (ZK) is a game-changer in the world of Web3. It empowers developers to create scalable and private applications. In many scenarios it is critically important to have a secret way to prove something is true without revealing any extra details:
- ZK proofs can authenticate identities without disclosing the actual identity information.
The verification of data integrity without exposing the data itself is beneficial for audits or proofs of existence where data needs to be validated without revealing its content.
- In DeFi applications ZK enables users to privately prove ownership or eligibility for certain financial activities without disclosing their holdings or transaction history.
- It can be utilized to validate the authenticity of products in supply chains.
- ZK proofs allow for anonymous voting while ensuring the integrity of the voting process, preventing double voting or tampering.
- In the context of ZKML, the prover can verify the integrity and accuracy of machine learning (ML) models outcome, when the computation occurs off-chain, without revealing any additional information.
- ZK proofs can ensure patient privacy by allowing medical institutions to perform computations on sensitive patient data without accessing the data itself.

Gear's capabilities are not limited to these examples. Many other scenarios and services can be implemented using the Gear Protocol.
