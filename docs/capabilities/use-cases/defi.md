Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a blockchain-based alternative to the current financial system. DeFi applications let you borrow, save, invest, trade, exchange, and do much more with your money than traditional financial systems allow. Whereas the current financial system is opaque, tightly controlled, and outdated - DeFi empowers individuals by giving them personal control and visibility over their finances. This new financial market, which has fewer intermediaries, can potentially be very beneficial for its users.

Deploying DeFi apps on Gear brings unique advantages. Thanks to Gear's highly scalable architecture, transactions on the Gear Network are processed at lightning speed and with minimal fees. 

With the Gear Protocol, users can enjoy a set-and-forget DeFi experience where their earnings are automatically deposited into their accounts without any manual intervention. Rewards are regularly harvested, swapped for the original vault asset, and deposited again for compound farming, allowing users to earn even more without having to take any additional action.

Its distinctive features, enabling on-chain automation for numerous use cases, make Gear a preferred option for developing financial applications. This cost and efficiency benefit can drive increased transactions, enhancing liquidity and activity within DeFi applications.
