Years ago, software development moved from monolithic to microservice architecture. Addressing complexities of the previous approach related to tightly coupled, interconnected code. In recent years, nanoservices have become mainstream to address known microservice complexity.

Any general-purpose language nanoservice function compiled to Wasm can be uploaded as a program to the Gear Network or a single node. Gear automatically scales according to the number of tasks necessary to process, charging only for the resources your function consumes.

In combination with other nanoservices on Gear, developers can quickly establish a functional architecture. This allows them to concentrate on the pieces of code that matter most, while Gear handles the rest â€“ a streamlined, efficient approach to app development that leverages the power and flexibility of the blockchain.
