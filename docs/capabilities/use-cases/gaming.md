The gaming industry is the largest and fast-growing entertainment business. It is larger than the movie and music industries combined.

During the gaming process, players create, buy, or exchange digital gaming assets. Blockchain technology perfectly fits in to carry out in-game transactions and confirm an asset's ownership and provenance. It enables new game mechanics and economic models (like the play-to-earn). Gaming programs take advantage of blockchain technology's security and transparency guarantees to ensure the protection of in-game assets represented by NFTs.

The primary features of the most popular games include exciting game mechanics that encourage repeated engagement, progression through levels, ease of entry and learning, the potential for rewards upon achievements and definitely ease of use.

However, many modern blockchain platforms struggle to meet these fundamental requirements independently. Their applications often demand users to install specialized wallet programs, create accounts, buy in-game currency, and engage in transaction signing, leading to inconveniences. To overcome these issues, these platforms resort to employing centralized components, the malfunction of which can render the entire application inoperative. Such practices are a far cry from achieving true decentralization.

By utilizing delayed messages, developers can implement optimizations that may not directly affect the user experience but ultimately yield a positive impact on the application's performance and cost for end users. For instance, in a gaming scenario where certain session data needs storing, employing delayed messages allows for timely clearance of completed data. This prevents excessive growth in program memory and reduces the expense associated with storing information on the blockchain.

The Gear Protocol provides a developer-friendly framework for creating fully on-chain games and deploying them on a decentralized network, such as **[Vara](https://vara.network/)**. Features like continuous automation (via delayed messages), payless and signless transactions, gas reservation, and more serve as essential tools for developers striving to craft successful games within the Gear decentralized network.

Game creators have realized the benefits of this technology and increasingly use it as one of the essential parts of their game architecture. Since transactions on Gear are very fast and cheap, it fits perfectly for highly loaded gaming applications with a huge number of transactions.
