NFTs are ways in which anything can be represented as a unique digital asset. They’re powered by smart contracts and they’re enabling creators to have more power and control over their work than ever before. NFTs let people represent ownership and tokenize assets like art, music, collectibles, tickets and even real estate. They can only have one official owner at a time and they’re secured by blockchain technology, which means that no one can modify the record of ownership or bring new ‘original’ NFTs into existence.

Tokenization has great potential to transform the landscape of traditional assets and financial markets. It will help create a global asset ecosystem where everything can be traded as easily as cryptocurrencies can.

One of the key features of NFTs is their dynamism, allowing their properties to be altered based on specific conditions. Dynamic NFTs can be promptly updated by their owner or automatically through delayed messages. The NFT program within the Gear Network can transmit messages to itself at regular intervals, enabling automatic updates to the token's properties. For instance, the NFT could modify itself based on factors like the duration of ownership, specific dates or times, time of day, seasonal changes, current price, price fluctuations over a period, and a myriad of other use cases that Gear allows developers to implement.
