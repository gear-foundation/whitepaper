DAOs are organizations that operate without central authority. They present a democratic and safe way to work with like-minded individuals worldwide. DAOs are usually fully democratized rather than hierarchical, requiring members to vote on proposals or any changes to be made. DAOs represent a radical departure from traditional organizations and offer a new model for collaboration and decision-making.
