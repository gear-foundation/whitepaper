title: Gear as a part of Dotsama ecosystem

The integration of Gear with the Dotsama projects (Polkadot/Kusama and other Substrate-based networks) brings about the creation of highly secure, massively interoperable decentralized applications. Polkadot is one of the fastest-growing multi-chain networks. However, by design, the Polkadot relay chain itself does not support smart contracts. The strength of the Polkadot network lies in its ability to route messages between chains. This unique functionality enables a communication channel between two parachains via asynchronous messages.

The fact that the Polkadot relay chain and Gear effectively speak the same language — asynchronous messages — enables projects built on Gear to seamlessly integrate their solutions into the broader Substrate-powered ecosystem. 

If deployed as a parachain, Gear's robust infrastructure for out-of-the-box dApp creation empowers any developer to construct and run programs (smart contracts), a process that often demands considerable time, effort, and cost on other platforms. Users could deploy programs to a Gear-powered parachain, and individual channels can then be established to other popular parachains or bridges (of which there can be many and competing). The entire Gear ecosystem could then communicate through these channels. A theoretical future Gear parachain would have the potential to enhance the Dotsama ecosystem and adapt to its evolving needs.
