Gear Protocol offers an innovative solution for creating purpose-specific, highly customizable decentralized applications (dApps). As a standalone network, it opens the door for developers to build and deploy dApps on a Gear network without needing to deploy and maintain their own blockchain. In addition, since Gear networks are Substrate-based, those dApps are natively interoperable and may communicate with other Substrate-based dApps and protocols. This is an extremely cost-effective and time-saving method for developers to integrate their dApps into the broader blockchain ecosystem.

Essentially, Gear offers a unique "Blockchain As A Service" (BaaS) solution. This allows developers to deploy smart contracts into Substrate ecosystems in a matter of minutes and at a fraction of the cost. With Gear, there's no need to build your own blockchain or recruit a validator set, thereby reducing barriers to entry and promoting a more diverse and innovative dApp landscape.

The first standalone network to utilize the Gear Protocol is [Vara Network](https://vara.network/). Vara utilizes the unique features and capabilities of Gear, showcasing the protocol's potential in enabling quick and easy deployment of feature-rich dApps that offer novel functionality not previously possible with contemporary smart contract platforms.
