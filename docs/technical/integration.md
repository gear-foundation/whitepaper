# Integration of Ethereum dApps with Gear.exe

## Methods

Gear.exe offers two distinct methods for integrating Ethereum dApps, allowing developers to choose the approach that best suits their application's requirements.

The first method, **Event-Based Integration**, relies on Ethereum smart contracts emitting events to request off-chain computations. These events are detected by Executors within the Gear.exe network, triggering the execution of the specified Wasm program. Once the computation is complete, the results are sent back to Ethereum through the Mirror Contract. This approach ensures a decentralized interaction between Ethereum and Gear.exe, maintaining the security and integrity of the process.

The second method, **Native Integration**, allows dApps to directly interact with their Gear programs via Remote Procedure Call (RPC). Unlike the event-based approach, native integration bypasses the need for Ethereum events, enabling real-time interactions with the Gear.exe network. This method is particularly advantageous for applications that require immediate results, as it leverages Gear.exe's pre-confirmation mechanism to provide outputs instantly.

Both integration methods are designed to be developer-friendly and scalable, ensuring that dApps can seamlessly incorporate Gear.exe's computational power without compromising security or performance.

## Brief Workflow for dApp Developers
1. **Define the Computationally Intensive Part.** Identify the resource-heavy segment of your dApp's business logic and rewrite it in Rust using Gear Protocol's Sails library. Compile the program into a Wasm module and generate an IDL (Interface Definition Language) file to describe its interface.
2. **Upload Your Wasm and IDL Files to Ethereum.** Publish your Wasm code and IDL file to the Ethereum network as part of a transaction. The code is stored as a blob, a data format accessible via Ethereum's archive nodes but stored outside the main state. This step prepares your program for integration with the Gear.exe network.
3. **Initialize Your Program in Gear.exe.** With a single action, activate your Wasm program on Gear.exe. This initialization process uploads the code to Gear.exe, establishes the program's initial state, and automatically deploys a corresponding Mirror Contract on Ethereum. The Mirror Contract serves as an interface, representing your dApp within the Ethereum ecosystem and facilitating seamless interaction between the two environments. 
4. **Leverage Lightning-Fast Computation.** Interact with your program by submitting messages through Ethereum, paying only the transaction fee for message submission. Alternatively, use the RPC interface to access your dApp's functionality directly without incurring additional costs.
5. **Finalization and Real-Time Availability.** Once your transaction is included in an Ethereum block, the computation is finalized and made available according to Ethereum's native finality mechanism. However, Gear.exe's pre-confirmation mechanism allows your dApp to utilize the results of computations instantly, even before the transaction is finalized on-chain. This feature ensures a near-instantaneous response time, bridging the gap between blockchain finality and real-time interaction.

Uploading programs and interacting with them is quite simple thanks to the developer-friendly tools provided by Gear.exe. Through the [Gear IDEA](https://idea.gear-tech.io/), anyone can easily integrate their Ethereum application with efficient computations on Gear.exe, upload a program, read its state, send a message, and much more.
