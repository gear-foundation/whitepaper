This document covers the main questions related to **Gear’s** mission, technology and advantages.

The key to **Gear’s** technological innovation lies behind the novel cross-program communication approach. Gear uses an Actor communication model and the Wasm VM, that enable parallel computation, exceptional speed and low transaction costs. Wasm VM is proven to be faster than any alternatives.

The Gear standard library enables developers to build applications using pre-built and optimized constructs. This enables writing applications quickly, focusing on the business logic of the application, instead of writing and debugging code for a long time. In addition, it can push the emergence of new business scenarios and applications.

Gear is essentially a blockchain-as-a-service as even developers that have no previous experience working with blockchains can enter the industry without advanced knowledge, previous experience or build custom networks. Developers can simply implement dApps and catapult them into the Gear Networks.

Beyond blockchain-specific functionalities, Gear offers a WAVM-based solution for off-chain computations. This enables developers to write programs in familiar languages and execute them at high speed, alleviating the burden of heavy off-chain calculations.

Platforms like Gear are what will enable the future of Web3 technologies to be created. Gear provides a foundational structure for building new types of applications and services that can help disintermediate and improve a wide range of industries tremendously. Gear is a catalyst for global innovation.

It must be noted that since Gear is always under development by the community, this document  may be subject to change in.
