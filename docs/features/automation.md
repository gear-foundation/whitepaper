In typical blockchain platforms, smart contracts react to events and only execute when invoked by a transaction. They respond to specific interactions from external entities, requiring these entities to initiate every action. While this design offers a certain degree of security, it tends to limit the potential for automation and adds complexity to the dApp's architecture.

Conversely, Gear Protocol facilitates **self-executing programs**, which have the power to act as autonomous agents. To achieve this, programs deployed to a Gear network can leverage a private “message queue” to enqueue future actions to be processed later, essentially allowing contracts to execute themselves recursively. This design is one of the key attributes that sets Gear apart, introducing enhanced automation and functionality to the ecosystem. In this model, such applications can be self-sustaining, operating for as long as the `gas pool` is funded (gas reservation for delayed messages). This is different from how many dApps work on Ethereum and other blockchains, which are forced to rely on off-chain computing and trusted oracles to provide a range of common features.

A significant advantage of self-executing programs in Gear Protocol is their ability to schedule future actions. Instead of relying on external entities to trigger events, these programs can schedule tasks to be executed in future blocks. This introduces the concept of 'time' in programs, enabling functionalities like time-locked payments, recurring events, self-cleaning storage and delayed execution of transactions. This feature alone opens up a wide array of use cases that were not previously feasible with traditional smart contract platforms.

The self-executing nature of Gear's program promotes a more dynamic and interactive environment, leading to the development of complex and high-functioning dApps. This autonomous capability opens the door to new paradigms of development, with programs behaving more like microservices in a traditional software architecture. Each program (or microservice) is responsible for its task, can make decisions, interact with others, and even spawn new programs when necessary. This modularity allows for more complex, flexible, and scalable dApp architectures.

Furthermore, these self-executing programs can receive, hold and send funds, allowing for the creation of truly autonomous and decentralized entities on the blockchain. This feature is particularly potent in the context of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), enabling self-governance and decision-making in a truly decentralized manner.

The self-executing program capabilities within the Gear Protocol offers a powerful framework that drives innovation and facilitates the construction of complex, efficient, and autonomous dApps for the future of Web3.0. This, combined with the benefits of autonomous decision-making, task scheduling, and greater modularity, significantly advances the evolution of the DeFi, gaming, infrastructure and other landscapes and enables the creation of brand-new services that were previously not viable via common smart contracts.
