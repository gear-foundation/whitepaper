Let’s consider the basic principles and components to better understand the technology behind the Gear Protocol.

**Gear** allows anyone to create and run any custom-logic dApp. We see Gear as a go-to solution for the following cases:
- Run arbitrary business logic dApps on a decentralized **Gear Network** at near-native speeds. Upload programs to the network and interact with them.
- Use a Gear node as a standalone instance running microservices, middleware, open API and more
- Being deployed as a Polkadot parachain establishes cross-chain communications between other blockchains, allowing anyone to run a dApp communicating within the Polkadot network in a very cost-efficient manner.
- Join Substrate-supported blockchains in any other platform outside Polkadot.
