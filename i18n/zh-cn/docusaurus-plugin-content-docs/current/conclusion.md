In this document we covered the main questions related to **Gear’s** mission, technology and competitive advantages.

The key to **Gear’s** technological innovation lies behind the novel cross-contract communication approach. **Gear** uses an Actor communication model and the WebAssembly VM, which enables parallel processing, exceptional speed and low transaction costs. WebAssembly VM is proven to be faster than any alternatives.

The **Gear** standard library enables developers to build applications using pre-built and optimized constructs. This enables writing applications quickly, focusing on the business logic of the application, instead of writing and debugging code for a long time. In addition, it can push the emergence of new business scenarios and applications.

**Gear** is essentially a blockchain-as-a-service as even developers that have no previous experience working with blockchains can enter the industry without advanced knowledge, previous experience or the need to take part in auctions, stake tokens or build custom networks. Developers can simply implement dApps and catapult them into the Polkadot ecosystem.

Platforms like **Gear** are what will enable the future of Web3 technologies to be created. **Gear** provides a foundational structure for building new types of applications and services that can help disintermediate and improve a wide range of industries tremendously. **Gear** is a catalyst for global innovation.

It must be noted that since **Gear** is under active development it makes this document a subject to change in the future.
