Today Polkadot is one of the fastest growing multi-chain networks. Nevertheless, it is not a smart contract platform by design. The Polkadot relay chain itself does not not support smart contracts. The critical aspect of the Polkadot network is its ability to route arbitrary messages between chains. The use of these messages enables a negotiation channel between two parachains via sending asynchronous messages through it.

**Gear’s** infrastructure for out-of-the-box dApp creation will allow any developer to build and run smart contracts easily, which takes much time, effort and cost on other platforms. But the cross-chain interoperability issues cannot be ignored. Becoming a parachain, we aim to improve the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem, adjust to its needs, and move the dApp market forward.

Polkadot relay chain and **Gear** ultimately speak the same language (asynchronous messages). Projects building on **Gear** can seamlessly integrate their solutions into the whole Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem.

Asynchronous messaging architecture allows **Gear** to be deployed as an effective and easy-to-use parachain of the Polkadot network. Users deploy programs to the **Gear Network**. Then, individual channels are established to popular parachains or bridges (there can be many and competing). And the whole **Gear parachain** communicates through them. Such architecture allows driving the transition of the network between states and fits nicely to the whole network.

We selected Substrate as a framework for **Gear** because:
- Integration with Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem leveraging the **Gear** significantly reduces expenses for developers
- Anyone can build dApps and deploy them on the **Gear parachain** without having to develop their own parachain
- **Gear’s** core contributors have an intimate knowledge of Polkadot/Kusama, which was leveraged to develop a better project
- The security model allows new parachains to be launched without having to look for new validators to protect them
- **Gear** will offer developers the best solutions and we are ready to help anyone implement smart contracts in their business processes.

To summarize, **Gear** will be offering a “Blockchain As A Service” solution, which allows all developers to deploy smart contracts into the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem in minutes and for pennies. With **Gear**, there’s no need to build your own blockchain or win a parachain slot.
