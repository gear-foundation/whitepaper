We think that the key to success and wide adoption of the **Gear** technology lies in ease of use and fast onboarding of our end customers - smart contract developers.

To get started with basics about how to write your smart contact on **Gear** and upload to the network, what prerequisites are required and how to set them up, **Gear** provides a single point of knowledge - the **[Gear Wiki](https://wiki.gear-tech.io/)**. 

The Wiki is aimed to include all information about **Gear** in a single place. It details **Gear’s** components and Rust libraries, how to build and run the Node and how to interact with it, how to write and test your smart contracts. It provides multiple smart contract examples for the most popular use cases such as - fungible and non-fungible tokens, DAO, DEX, NFT marketplace, auction, lottery and more. Some smart contract examples are accompanied with the user interface implementation that demonstrate integration capabilities between anyone’s frontend/backend and smart contracts on a **Gear Network**.

[**Gear IDEA**](https://idea.gear-tech.io) is a convenient tool that’s purpose is to familiarize users with the **Gear Protocol**. It provides smart-contract developers with the easiest and fastest way to write, compile, test and upload smart-contracts to a test network directly in their browser without additional configuration.

This is the demo application that implements all possibilities of interaction with smart-contracts in **Gear** - upload a new smart contract, send a message to a contract and get a response. The IDEA also allows managing accounts and balances, observing transaction events, providing simple IDE and more.
