While **Gear Technologies** is a core contributor to the **Gear Protocol**, the **Gear Foundation** is an independent nonprofit foundation intended to support the development and usage of a **Gear Network**.

The **Gear Foundation’s** mission is to lower the barrier to entry for blockchain development, to introduce an entirely new pool of talented developers to the Web3 and blockchain industry, onboarding them to the innovative and interoperable Substrate ecosystem. We hope that this will spur adoption and usage of blockchain technology, unleashing the potential of the next evolution of the internet - Web3.

**Gear Foundation** wants to support developers and applications that will add utility to the **Gear** ecosystem. Projects will have the ability to participate in the **Gear** ecosystem by joining the Grants Program. It will provide support and expertise that will maximize the project's usage and development. Projects that join the program will receive access to resourcing, developer tools, end-to-end support and a network of developers and connections throughout the industry.

Another initiative set up by **Gear Foundation** is the **Gear Ambassador** program. It is intended to provide a platform for members of the **Gear** community to organize, participate in, and create awareness about the **Gear** ecosystem. The main goal of the ambassador program is to educate the **Gear** community and others about developments in Web3 technology and **Gear Network**. This includes producing original educational and informational content like videos and articles, organizing and hosting online and in-person development workshops and hackathons, contributing to technical documentation, translating existing educational material, and engaging with community platforms by sharing knowledge about **Gear** and answering questions on Discord or partaking in conversations on platforms like Telegram.

Moreover, the **Gear Foundation** will collaborate with, and support, existing projects that are written on different frameworks and running on other networks to deploy their applications on a **Gear Network**. We expect our simple and understandable framework to enable effortless re-implementation of existing smart contracts from other networks. This, in turn, will enhance cross-chain interoperability and expand the utilization of these applications.
